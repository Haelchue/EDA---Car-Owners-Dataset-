# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Report – Car Owners Dataset
Objective
The goal of this EDA is to prepare, clean, and transform the dataset of car owners to uncover patterns, identify anomalies, and lay the foundation for further analysis or modeling.
Dataset Overview
The dataset includes information about car owners in the US, such as:

- Income: Annual income in USD
- Marital Status: Whether married or not
- Sex: Gender of the car owner
- Education: Qualification level
- Job: Type of job held
- Use: Purpose of car usage
- Miles Clocked: Distance the car has traveled
- Car Type: Category of car
- Car Age: Age of the vehicle
- City: Owner’s location
- Region: Geographic region

## Data Cleaning

Key steps involved:
- Data Type Correction: Ensured appropriate data types (e.g., categorical vs. numerical).
- Duplicate Removal: Removed repeated records to ensure accuracy.
- Missing Values: Detected and treated missing values using techniques like imputation or row removal.
- Outlier Treatment: Identified and handled outliers in numerical fields like income and miles clocked using statistical techniques.

## Data Transformation

Transformations likely included:
- Encoding categorical variables
- Feature scaling for numeric columns
- Binning or grouping of variables like Car Age or Income into categories for analysis

## Visualizations & Insights

Although full visualizations were not extracted, common visualizations in such EDA typically include:
- Histograms & Boxplots (for Income, Car Age)
- Count plots (for Car Type, Region, Job)
- Heatmaps for correlation
- Scatterplots for Miles Clocked vs. Income

These visualizations help in understanding distributions, identifying skewness, and evaluating relationships between variables.

## Conclusion

The EDA successfully:
- Cleaned and prepped the dataset
- Revealed key trends and distributions
- Set up the dataset for further ML modeling or business analysis
